How the internet works

----------------------
Wires, Cables and Wifi

bits -> kb, mb, gb

A bit is the smallest unit of data on a computer.

A bit is either a 0 or a 1? 

3 ways to transmit this data? 

1. Electricity (Ethernet) - cheap - short distance
2. Light (Optical) - VERY FAST and Reliable - Expensive, hard to work with
3. Radio - wireless - it's short distance

----------
IP and DNS
----------

IP - Internet Protocol
IP Address - Unique numerical address for a device

DNS
Domain Name System
Send a domain name and get back an IP address.

DNS Spoofing
Hacking into a DNS server to make it give you a bad IP address.

--------------------------------
Packets, Routing and Reliability
--------------------------------

Packets - the data (bits) that makes up music or photos is broken into small packets. Packets have a sending IP address and a receiving IP address.

[PACKET]
[[DATA]]
[[S IP]]
[[R IP]]

Routers - take packets and send them to the next router until the packet reaches it's final destination.

TCP
Transmission Control Protocol - uses for the final destination to do an inventory of the packets. Missing packets are sent again.
